This was a project for HackNY spring 2013.  Along with [Joe Yuan](https://github.com/joeyuan19) and [Bezia Ladderman](https://github.com/darien0).  

The program requires a few extra libraries to run - Node.JS. 

						==================

GOAL: Have two computers determine their physical seperation using nothing other than their speakers and microphones. 
Each computer is running a small client so that we can issue terminal commands remotely.

RESULTS: On our best trial we were able to determine a seperation of 1.2 m when the actual seperation was 1.5 m.

						==================

When set up properly two computers can connect to a node.js server, sycnchronize, and alternatively emit sound waves.  The time delay is then recorded, exchanged, and the distance is calculated.  The measurement is essentially a counting experiment so the more data recorded the more accurate the measurement.

April 29 2013: Commited without any post-hackathon updates.  Set up to run specifically on the computers used during the competition.
	Two Windows - based Machines

Future updates for universal usability possible.
